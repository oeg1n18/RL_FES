    %% NOTE: usually muscles are modelled as a Hammerstein system with an "isometric recruitment curve (IRC)"
    %% static function that goes before the LAD. However in this model we ignore the IRC for simplicity.
    %% This just means that the "stimulation" we apply as input will be very small (less than 1) as is
    %% basically corresponds to torque

    %% to test the model, let's apply a ramp to some of the 7 muscles
    %% values umax > 0.2 make the outputs go extremely large as we are applying a ramp and we only have a simple stiffness form
